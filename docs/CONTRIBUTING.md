## Branching Rules

### Types of Branches

- `main`: For production use. Only accepts PRs from `develop` (and `hotfix` in emergencies).
- `staging`: For testing. Only accepts PRs from `develop`.
- `develop`: Accepts PRs from `feature` branches.
- `feature/`: Individual branches for each issue.
- `hotfix/`: Branches for urgent fixes.
- `docs/`: Branches for documentation updates.

### Branch Naming Conventions

- Feature Addition: `feature/<issue_number>-<brief_description>` (develop ⇔ feature)
- Hotfix: `hotfix/<issue_number>-<brief_description>` (main ⇔ hotfix)
- Documentation Update: `docs/<issue_number>-<brief_description>` (develop ⇔ docs)

*Note: `<issue_number>-` can be omitted if the modification is not based on an issue.*


#### Examples

- feature/42-user-authentication
- hotfix/56-security-vulnerability-fix
- docs/108-update-installation-guide

## Testing

- Write unit tests for your features.
- Make sure all tests pass locally and on the CI server.
- Update existing tests if you modify code that affects them.
